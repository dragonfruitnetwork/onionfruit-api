## Overview
This repo holds the server-side components used to provide OnionFruit&trade; clients with geolocation data, alongside Tor connection detection services.

The system is split into two systems:
- The worker process that collects and produces the data required to serve user requests
- The server responsible for serving user-initiated requests for data (designed to scale horizontally independent of the worker process)

### Deployment
Deployment can be done on either a Windows or Linux-based server. Docker images are built on each release for both the server and worker images and can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dragonfruitdotnet/onionfruit-web)

See deployment.md for further instruction on how to deploy.
