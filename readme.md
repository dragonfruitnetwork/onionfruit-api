## Overview
This repo holds the server-side components used to provide OnionFruit&trade; clients with geolocation data, alongside Tor connection detection services.

The system is split into two systems:
- The worker process that collects and produces the data required to serve user requests
- The server responsible for serving user-initiated requests for data (designed to scale horizontally independent of the worker process)

### Deployment

WIP - will be completed once the project is more complete.
